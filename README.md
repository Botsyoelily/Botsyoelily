## 👋🏽 Hello, I'm Lily

When people hear “privacy,” they often think of national security, enterprise data governance, or regulatory compliance. But my focus is on a different kind of privacy — the kind that affects everyday users. I explore how design choices, nudges, and policies shape what individuals know, consent to, and experience online. My work sits at the intersection of user-centered design, privacy awareness, and ethical technology, with a lens on open source as a tool for transparency and empowerment.
